# Bitcoin DNA

Bitcoin DNA is an innovative web application that transforms Bitcoin seed phrases into unique, visually striking DNA-like patterns. Each visualization is deterministically generated from the cryptographic properties of a Bitcoin wallet, creating a unique "genetic fingerprint" that represents the wallet's underlying cryptographic data.
