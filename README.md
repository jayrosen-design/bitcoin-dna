# Bitcoin DNA

**Bitcoin DNA** is a visualization tool that transforms Bitcoin seed phrases into unique DNA-like patterns. Each Bitcoin seed phrase creates a unique DNA animation with patterns deterministically generated from the cryptographic properties of the wallet.

## Features

- **DNA Visualization:** Transform Bitcoin seed phrases into unique DNA-like visualizations

- **Interactive Visualization:**  
  Upload your own seed phrase JSON files to generate custom DNA animations

- **Gallery Section:**  
  Browse a collection of Bitcoin DNA NFTs showcasing different seed phrases

- **Matrix Visualization:**
  Explore alternative visualization styles for Bitcoin cryptographic data

## How It Works

1. **Hash Generation:**  
   SHA-256 and SHA-512 hashing algorithms create deterministic patterns unique to your keys.

2. **DNA Mapping:**  
   The hash values control DNA helix properties, creating visual patterns that are unique to your wallet.

3. **Animation:**  
   The DNA patterns are animated to create a dynamic representation of your Bitcoin seed phrase.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Access the App:**  
   Open your web browser and navigate to:

2. **Upload a Seed Phrase:**  
   - Visit the BTC DNA page
   - Upload a JSON file containing a Bitcoin seed phrase
   - View the generated DNA visualization

3. **Browse the Gallery:**  
   Explore the collection of Bitcoin DNA NFTs to see examples of different seed phrases and their unique DNA patterns.
